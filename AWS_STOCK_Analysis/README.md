Overview of Project

This project builds a real-time stock market data analytics pipeline using AWS, leveraging event-driven architecture and serverless technologies. The architecture ingests, processes, stores, and analyzes stock market data in real-time while minimizing costs.


Key tasks include:

- Streaming real-time stock data from sources like yfinance using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.
- Processing data and detecting anomalies with AWS Lambda.
- Storing processed stock data in Amazon DynamoDB for low-latency querying.
- Storing raw stock data in Amazon S3 for long-term analytics.
- Querying historical data using Amazon Athena.
- Sending real-time stock trend alerts using AWS Lambda & Amazon SNS (Email/SMS).

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how to build a near real-time stock market data analytics pipeline using AWSâ€™s fully managed, serverless services. By integrating Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, Amazon Athena, and Amazon SNS, we've created a robust and scalable architecture capable of streaming, processing, storing, analyzing, and alerting on stock data with minimal operational overhead.

Key outcomes include:
Real-time data ingestion and processing with event-driven architecture.
Anomaly detection and trend alerts using AWS Lambda and SNS.
Separation of raw and processed data for efficient storage and analytics.
Low-cost implementation suitable for learning and prototyping.
